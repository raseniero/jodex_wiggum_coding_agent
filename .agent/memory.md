# User Preferences and Project Conventions

## Project Structure
- **PRD Location:** All Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) must be stored in the `prd/` directory.
- **PRD Folder Naming:** Each PRD should have its own subfolder within `prd/` following the pattern: `prd/<id>_<name>/` (e.g., `prd/001_deployment_script/`).
- **PRD File Naming:** The main requirement file within the subfolder should be named `REQ.md`.

## Deployment Configuration
- **Claude Skills Directory:** `~/.claude/skills/`
- **Project Skills Source:** `./skills/`
